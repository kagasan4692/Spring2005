If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I
Will always love you
I will always love you

You
My darling, you
Mm, mm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I
Will always love you
I will always love you
You
